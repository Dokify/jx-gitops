## jx-gitops apply

Performs a GitOps regeneration and apply on a cluster git repository

### Usage

```
jx-gitops apply
```

### Synopsis

Performs a gitops regeneration and apply on a cluster git repository 

If the last commit was a merge from a pull request the regeneration is skipped. 

Also the process detects if an ingress has changed (or similar changes) and retriggers another regeneration which typically is only required when installing for the first time or if no explicit domain name is being used and the LoadBalancer service has been removed.

### Examples

  # performs a regeneration and apply
  jx-gitops apply

### Options

```
  -d, --dir string                        the directory to the git and make commands (default ".")
  -h, --help                              help for apply
      --last-commit-msg-contains string   matches if last-commit-msg contains the given text
      --last-commit-msg-prefix string     matches if last-commit-msg has the given prefix
      --last-commit-msg-suffix string     matches if last-commit-msg has the given suffix
```
